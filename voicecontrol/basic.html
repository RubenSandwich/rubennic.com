      <h1>Basic Example</h1>

      <p>
        Use this example to get comfortable moving to and from elements with
        VoiceOver.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a longer bit of text so you can practice stopping and starting
        VoiceOver. The rest of this test doesn't really say anything important.
        It just goes on and on without having much of a point.
