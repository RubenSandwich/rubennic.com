          I'm a human-centric software engineer. Software's artifacts, both product and source code, are made for and by humans. They should be built to conform to our feebleness; our small short-term memory, our dependency on failing bodies, and our short attention span due to constant stimuli. Don't reinvent humans in the shape of computers, reinvent software in the shape of humans.
